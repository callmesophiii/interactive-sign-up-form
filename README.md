# Interactive-Sign-Up-Form

📝 Reflection Questions
1. How did event.preventDefault() help?
It stopped the form from submitting too early, so we could validate inputs first.

2. HTML5 vs. JavaScript validation – why both?
HTML5 is simple and fast; JavaScript allows custom rules. Together, they improve reliability and user experience.

3. How was localStorage used, and what are its limits?
Stored and retrieved the username for persistence. Not secure; don’t use it for sensitive data.

4. Challenge with real-time validation?
Avoiding premature error messages; solved by checking input on blur and input events.

5. How were error messages handled?
Messages were clear, short, and only shown when needed to guide users without clutter.
